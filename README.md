## Introduction 
OctreeBVHVoxelizer is a C++ project designed to convert 3D models into voxel representations. 
It includes features for voxel face creation, file parsing, bounding volume hierarchy (BVH)
construction, and efficient spatial partitioning. This project aims to provide a lightweight
platform for rendering 3D-models as voxels and to explore different optimization methods. 

## Installation

- Clone the repository
- Navigate to the project directory
- Run the build script
- Install the necessary dependencies 
  - OpenGL 
  - SDL2 
- Create a ./binaries directory and put your 3D models 
- Adjust the 3D model path in src/constants.hpp
